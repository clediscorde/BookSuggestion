# BookSuggestion
Coding Assignment â€“ Book Suggestion App

I code this assignment not only to code an assignment, but also to explore technologies I'm less familiar with.

## Technologies

The following technologies were used:
* Java
* Maven
* MongoDB
* Spring
* Spring MVC
* Spring Data Mongo
* Rest
* Html
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap css
* Junit
* Mockito

## Interfaces

### UI

* The web interface contains fields to search book suggestions.
* URI: /

### REST

#### Add/modify book:

* Method: POST
* URI: /books/save
* Data example:
```
{
    "id":"562ec8910364d102131849c5"
    "title": "Classic 123",
    "author": "Classic Author 2",
    "genre": "Adventure",
    "numberOfPage": 1000,
    "yearOfPublication": 1884,
    "overallRating": 4
}
```
* To modify a book, the id must be included in the post request
* To add a book, the id must not be included in the post request

#### Delete book:
* Method: GET
* URI: /books/delete/{id}
* {id} is the id of the book to delete

## Database
* The data is saved in a MongoDB, hosted on MongoLab.
* This is possible to change the database configuration in config.properties.

## Other possible improvements
* Add/modify/delete books via the web UI
* Client side validation
* Client side error handling
* Better user interface
